# 01 Challenge Code Refractor

## Description

A marketing agency wanted a webpage that followed accessibility standards and one that is optimized for search engines. I was given a code base to work off of, in which I made improvements to the code itself, reducing redundancy and making the code more tidy. I helped the marketing agency ensure that there webpage can be accessed by everyone and that they would get more hits on search engines. Overall, I learned more about styling multiple html elements/classes at once.
